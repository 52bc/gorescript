gorescript
==========

The goal of this project is to build **a Doom-like game from scratch**, complete with its **own asset creation toolchain**.

Besides the game itself, it features:

* A 2.5D sector-based **map editor**
* A basic **voxel editor** for monster, weapon and powerup meshes

**Latest assets .zip**: http://goo.gl/FDqYXh (copy to **/src/game**)

**Very crude guides can be found [here](https://github.com/timeinvariant/gorescript/wiki), for the following topics:**

* How to run the development version of gorescript (/src folder)

* How to build and run gorescript (/build folder)

* How to configure the save server for the map/voxel editors
