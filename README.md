gorescript
==========

The goal of this project is to build **a Doom-like game from scratch**, complete with its **own asset creation toolchain**.

Besides the game itself, it features:

* A 2.5D sector-based **map editor**
* A basic **voxel editor** for monster, weapon and powerup meshes

**See [releases](https://github.com/timeinvariant/gorescript/releases) for corresponding asset bundles.**
